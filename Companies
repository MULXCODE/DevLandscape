In November, 2020, we moved the core database into a public Google sheet. By moving to a public Google sheet, we can: 
  a) allow others to copy the data more easily, 
  b) link to ranges of companies, such as all companies in a particular category, 
  c) make it easier to snapshot changes between two named versions, and 
  d) automate the replication of data between our private tracking database and the public view.
